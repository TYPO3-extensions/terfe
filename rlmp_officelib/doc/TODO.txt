rlmp_officelib TODO
===================

-	FEATURE: Create PHP 5.0 style object functions like __construct() etc. and iterators ...
-	BUG: Check for PHP 5.0 compatibility: is_array () and isset () may cause errors

-	FEATURE: Implement date / time formats / -styles
-	FEATURE: Conditional styles support for paragraphs and in general
-	FEATURE: Implement sequences (3.7.37 XML spec): They are used for global numbering!

GENERAL TWEAKS

-	the createIterator method could be implemented with a cleaner factory method approach
-	Iterator should generally follow the SPL way of methods and be replaced with SPL at some point
-	Parsing the XML should possibly better done with SAX for memory reasons

KNOWN ISSUES

-	Does probably not support Asian documents
