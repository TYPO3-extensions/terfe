			<para>Here's how a code sample looks like:</para>

			<programlisting>$a = 1;</programlisting>
			<programlisting>if ($a = 2) {</programlisting>
			<programlisting>$a = 3;</programlisting>

							</entry>

								<para>string</para>
							</entry>
							<entry>
								<para>If property RO is set (see below) then you can set this property to a certain set of parameters which will allow you to change the background color of e.g. the table cell when the mouse rolls over you text-link.</para>
								<para/>
								<para>Syntax:</para>
								<para>[over-color] | [out-color] | [id-prefix]</para>
								<para/>
								<para>Example:</para>
								<para>page = PAGE</para>
								<para>page.typeNum = 0</para>
								<para>page.10 = HMENU</para>
								<para>page.10.wrap = &lt;table border=1&gt;|&lt;/table&gt;</para>
								<para>page.10.1 = TMENU</para>
								<para>page.10.1.NO {</para>
								<para>&#xA0; allWrap = &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=top id="1tmenu{elementUid}" style="background:#eeeeee;"&gt;|&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;</para>
								<para>&#xA0; subst_elementUid = 1</para>
								<para>&#xA0; RO_chBgColor = #cccccc | #eeeeee | 1tmenu</para>
								<para>&#xA0; RO = 1</para>
								<para>}</para>
								<para/>
								<para>This example will start out with the table cells in #eeeeee and change them to #cccccc (and back) when rolled over. The &#x201C;1tmenu&#x201D; string is a unique id for the menu items. You may not need it (unless the same menu items are more than once on a page), but the important thing is that the id of the table cell has the exact same label before the {elementUid} (red marks). The other important thing is that you DO set a default background color for the cell with the style-attribute (blue marking). If you do not, Mozilla browsers will behave a little strange by not capturing the mouseout event the first time it's triggered. </para>
