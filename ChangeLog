Version 1.0.5 16.09.2008 Robert Lemke <robert@typo3.org>
	* Checked in the most recent version from typo3.org into Forge
	- Removed the reviewed / unreviewed list view for extensions from the menu
	- The extension version number is not shown in the URL anymore
	- Obsolete extensions are now marked as such (again)

Version 1.0.4 20.03.2007 Robert Lemke <robert@typo3.org>
		+ Improved the caching of extension files for the ter_fe details view: Files are now only unpacked again if the md5 sum of the T3X file (not the extensions.xml.gz) changed.
		+ Changed the tx_terfe / contentcache file structure: now the files of each extension reside in their own subdirectory.

Version 1.0.3 16.12.2006 Robert Lemke <robert@typo3.org>
	# Fixed bug 0004086: extension rating shows 0 (zero) instead of "-" or nothing
	# If no title was defined for an extension, links in ter_fe will now have the label "Untitled"
	+ Added a little feature (#0004053): You can now link to the single view of the most current version of an extension by omitting the "version" get parameter or setting version to "current".

Version 1.0.2 15.12.2006 Robert Lemke <robert@typo3.org>
	+ Added feature "Render Problems" link which explains why documents were not rendered. (See extension ter_doc_renderproblems)

Version 1.0.1, 14.12.2006 Robert Lemke <robert@typo3.org>
	# Fixed download counter display

01.09.2005 Robert Lemke <robert@typo3.org>

15.05.2006 Michael Scharkow <michael@underused.org>
	* Finished ratings, with changes from public beta
	* ATTN: Please remove reference to my server in common class icon
	function (although it should never occur on typo3.org

22.03.2006 Michael Scharkow <michael@underused.org>
	* Fixed small issues (locallang, docstrings, variable names)
	* Added stylesheet file and icons in res/ (copy to fileadmin, please!)

16.03.2006 Robert Lemke <robert@typo3.org>
	* Removed dummy content from renderListView_detailledExtensionRecord(). That was very confusing because in the list view the documentation link was always "not available" and downloadcounter "12333/32111" - because it was hardcoded. Please make sure to clean up before you commit.
