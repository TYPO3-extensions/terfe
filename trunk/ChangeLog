	* Added stylesheet file and icons in res/ (copy to fileadmin, please!)

	* Removed dummy content from renderListView_detailledExtensionRecord(). That was very confusing because in the list view the documentation link was always "not available" and downloadcounter "12333/32111" - because it was hardcoded. Please make sure to clean up before you commit.
